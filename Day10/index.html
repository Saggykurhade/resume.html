        a programmer who
        develops World Wide Web applications using a client–server model. The applications typically use HTML, CSS, and
        JavaScript in the client, and any general-purpose programming language in the server. HTTP is used for
        communications between client and server. A web developer may specialize in client-side applications (Front-end
        web development), server-side applications (back-end development), or both (full-stack development).
